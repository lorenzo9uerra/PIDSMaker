In this tutorial, we craft a brand new architecture using existing components in the framework and evaluate it on node-level intrusion detection.

## Architecture

Our goal is to create a first system that uses as encoder a `GAT` and only node types as node features, then propose a more advanced variant that concatenates node types with text embeddings computed from entity paths with `word2vec`.
The node embeddings generated by the encoder are then fed to a 2-layer MLP decoder and we train the model in a self-supervised manner to reconstruct the input node features, similarly as an autoencoder.
In a final step, we aim to threshold the predict malicious scores if their predicted scores exceed a threshold, computed as the max loss seen on the validation set.

**Approach**: The aim of PIDSMaker is to build such architecture in a no-code approach, by only tweaking some arguments within YML configuration files.

## Decoder and Objective

``` yaml title="config/example.yml"
detection:
  gnn_training:
    decoder:
      used_methods: predict_edge_type
      predict_edge_type:
        decoder: edge_mlp
        use_triplet_types: False
        edge_mlp:
          architecture_str: linear(0.5) | relu
          src_dst_projection_coef: 2
```
