# Development

## Pro tips

We provide some tips for those willing to contribute to PIDSMaker.

- **Use dev container in VSCode**: all interactions with PIDSMaker are made via the `pids` container. For a nicer dev experience, we highly recommend opening your VSCode window directly into the container for debuging purposes. More details [here](ten-minute-install.md#get-into-the-pidsmaker-container).
- **Avoid concurrent runs from scratch**: if you launch 2 runs simultaneously, each with the same `build_graphs` config and same dataset, the files generated by each run will write concurrently in the same folder, leading to potentially invisible conflicts. To avoid this, you should launch the first run and wait for it to complete the first tasks to not overlap with concurrent runs. Once concurrent tasks are completed, you can run as many parallel runs as long as they start from a task with different arguments. Another way is to launch each run using `--restart_from_scratch` to ensure no overlap.
