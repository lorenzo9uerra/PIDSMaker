# PIDSMaker ðŸ¥·

The first framework designed to build and experiment with provenance-based intrusion detection systems (PIDSs) using deep learning architectures. 
It provides a single codebase to run most recent state-of-the-arts systems and easily customize them to develop new variants.

**Currently supported PIDSs**:
